You can send a text to be converted into audio, using different TTS engines and sound effects. Then, you will be listening to it on your local audio device, or receiving the resultant audio file.

## Setup

First, you should install the supported TTS engines:

### GoogleSpeech setup

```sh
apt install python3 sox libsox-fmt-mp3
pip install google_speech
```

### gTTS setup

```sh
apt install python3 sox libsox-fmt-mp3
pip install gTTS
```

### Festival setup

```sh
apt install festival festvox-ellpc11k
```

### eSpeak setup

```sh
apt install espeak
```

You also need to install **nodejs** and **npm**, and then, simply run `npm install` and `npm start`.
The API should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Or you can just use [pedroetb/tts-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/pedroetb/tts-api) **Docker** image, which already has all dependencies configured.

## Setup using Docker

The only requirement is to have **Docker** installed. Then, you can run:

```sh
docker run --rm -d --name tts-api --device /dev/snd -p 3000:3000 pedroetb/tts-api
```

The API will be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, you can deploy it in a **Docker Swarm** cluster using `docker compose` (already included in Docker if using modern version) and `docker swarm` (create Swarm cluster first):

```sh
cd deploy

# Deploy Caddy service
env $(grep -v '^[#| ]' .env | xargs) \
 TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=change.me \
 docker stack deploy \
 -c compose.caddy.yaml \
 tts-api

# Run TTS-API container
docker compose \
 -f compose.tts-api.yaml \
 -p tts-api \
 up -d
```

The service is prepared to be reverse-proxied with **Traefik**, and accessible at `tts.${TRAEFIK_DOMAIN}` domain. How to run **Traefik** is not described here, check its [official site](https://traefik.io).

The proxy needs a little help from **Caddy**, because Docker Swarm is not compatible with devices configuration (required to use sound capabilities) and Traefik cannot work with Docker containers and Docker Swarm services all at once. This way, only **Caddy** service is exposed using **Traefik** and `tts-api` container is only accessible through reverse-proxy provided by **Caddy** (same way **Traefik** is reverse-proxing to **Caddy**).

Both, Docker container and service, can be running on different hosts, because they are able to communicate through a Docker overlay network. Run `tts-api` Docker container on host which has speakers, so you can listen speech.

Don't forget to edit `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN` environment variable before deploying.

## Usage

When running, the API will receive POST requests at `http://localhost:3000`.
You can use your favourite REST client to send a request, or use the built-in form.

Both modes (playing or downloading audio) are available using different voice codes, select one according to your needs.

### Built-in form

Go to `http://localhost:3000` with your browser, fill the form with data and submit it. Just that.

### Send POST request

You can send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000` following this scheme:

* **Headers**
  * **Content-Type**: `application/json`
* **Body**
  * `{ "voice": "google_speech", "textToSpeech": "hello world", "language": "en", "speed": "1" }`

For example, using `curl`:

```sh
# Play audio
curl http://localhost:3000 \
 -d '{ "voice": "google_speech", "textToSpeech": "hello world", "language": "en", "speed": "1" }' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# Download audio file
curl http://localhost:3000 \
 -d '{ "voice": "gtts_file", "textToSpeech": "hello world", "language": "en", "speed": "1" }' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -o 'output.mp3'
```

## Available TTS engines

### GoogleSpeech engine

Google Speech is a simple multiplatform command line tool to read text using Google Translate TTS (Text To Speech) API.

You need to be online to communicate with Google servers.

Learn more at <https://github.com/desbma/GoogleSpeech>

### gTTS engine

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.

You need to be online to communicate with Google servers.

Learn more at <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS>

### Festival engine

Festival is a free software multi-lingual speech synthesis workbench that runs on multiple-platforms offering black box text to speech, as well as an open architecture for research in speech synthesis.

It works offline.

Learn more at <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/> and <http://festvox.org/festival/>

### eSpeak engine

eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows.

It works offline.
